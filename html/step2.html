            <h1>Prophase</h1>
            <h4>Cells break down into parts to be reconfigured.</h4>

            <p>The DNA condenses into a kind of condensed form of the chromosomes and the nuclear envelope, the nuclear membrane starts to disappear. Then the duplicated chromosomes appear as two identical sister chromatids which are joined by the centromeres of each sister chromatids. The formation of the mitotic spindle is next which begins to form in the cytoplasm of the cell and is crucial to the rest of the mitosis stage. This is created by centrosomes and the microtubules that extend from them which make the centrosomes migrate to the opposite ends of the cell. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Spindle Apparatus (Mitotic Spindle)</h3>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:300px;">

            </div>
            <p>When the chromosomes separate, that start to form something known as the spindle apparatus. </p>
            <br>
            
            <h1>Prometaphase</h1>
            <h4>Condense Chromosomes</h4>
            <p>The nuclear envelope that encloses the nucleus in the G2 phase fragments, allowing for space in which the microtubules that extended from each of the centrosomes invade the nuclear area.  In the prometaphase, the chromosomes become even more condensed. This condensed form attaches a kinetochore which is a specialized protein structure at the center of the centromere that then attaches to the microtubules. The microtubules without an attached kinetochore are called nonkinetochore microtubules and attach with other nonkinetochore microtubules on the opposite side of the spindle. </p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="main">
            <h1>Metaphase</h1>
            <h4>Makes sure everything is properly set up.</h4>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:300px;">
                <img src="../images/pg3_3.jpg" alt="Cell Cycle" style="width:75%;height:100%;">
            </div>
            <p>At this point of the Mitotic stage the centrosomes are now at opposite ends of the cell and their microtubules meet at an equidistant plane from the spindles poles. This equidistant plane is known as the metaphase plate in which the chromosomesâ€™ centromeres lie and for each chromosome, the kinetochores of the sister chromatids are attached to kinetochore microtubules which come from the opposite poles or the centrosomes. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Checkpoints</h3>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:300px;">
                <img src="../images/pg3_4.jpg" alt="Cell Cycle" style="width:75%;height:100%;">
            </div>
            <p>The checkpoints make sure that the chromosomes are binded to the kinetochore microtubules correctly, so that the chromosomes divide equally. </p>
            <p>By going through this procedure, it prevents the chance of mutation. If the checkpoints aren't met, mitosis will be put on hold until all the problems are fixed. </p>
            <h3>First Checkpoint</h3>
            <p>At G1 it checks for the go-ahead signal, if there is no signal then the cell enters the G0 Phase. </p>
            <h3>Second Checkpoint</h3>
            <p>At the end of G2, the go-ahead signal is received once it makes sure that it has all the necessary nutrients. </p>
            <h3>Third Checkpoint</h3>
            <p>At Anaphase, during the mitotic phase, there is a checkpoint which makes sure all the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle at the metaphase plate. Once this checks out the rest of the cycle is allowed to be completed. </p>
