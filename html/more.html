            <h1>Regulation of cell</h1>
            <p>The sequential events of the cell cycle are directly controlled by the cell cycle control system. It is a operating set of molecules in the cell that triggers and coordinates the key events in the cell cycle. The system also checks the events by using checkpoints, which is a control point where stop and go-ahead signals can regulate the signal. These checkpoints halt the cell cycle until they are overridden with by go-ahead signals. These stops make sure that crucial steps have been correctly completed, if not then the cell enters the G0 phase which is a nondividing state. The cell cycle is regulated at the molecular level by a set of regulatory proteins and protein complexes. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>First Checkpoint</h3>
            <p>At G1 it checks for the go-ahead signal, if there is no signal then the cell enters the G0 Phase. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Second Checkpoint</h3>
            <p>At the end of G2, the go-ahead signal is received once it makes sure that it has all the necessary nutrients. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Third Checkpoint</h3>
            <p>At Anaphase, during the mitotic phase, there is a checkpoint which makes sure all the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle at the metaphase plate. Once this checks out the rest of the cycle is allowed to be completed. </p>

            <h4>A faulty Cell Cycle Control System leads to cancer cells.</h4>
            <p> Cancer cells can go on dividing indefinitely if they are given a continual supply of nutrients. Cancer cells also evade the the normal controls that trigger a a cell to undergo a type of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Usually, the immune system recognizes a transformed cancer cell as a insurgent and destroys it. However, if the cell evades the destruction the continued separation and growth of cells create a tumor. There are two types of tumors, a benign tumor which does not cause serious problems and can be completely removed by surgery and malignant tumor which its genetic and cellular changes enable them to spread and affect the functions of more than one organ. An individual with a malignant tumor is said to have cancer. These cells not only show up in excessive proliferation but they also have an unusual number of chromosomes. They can be treated but have side effects on the regular cell system. This may cause irregularities and if untreated; Death. </p>
