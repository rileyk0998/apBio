            <h1>Anaphase</h1>
            <h4>Chromosomes seperate. </h4>

            <p>This is the shortest phase of mitosis and only last a few minutes. Anaphase begins when the kinetochore, the protein that held together the chromatids, is cleaved which causes the sister chromatids to part suddenly and each becomes its own chromosome. The freed daughter chromosomes then move to the opposite ends of the cell still attached to the kinetochore microtubules which shorten as they move. Since they are attached to the centromere region they move centromere first. During this, the cell elongates as the nonkinetochore microtubules lengthen. At the end of anaphase, the two ends of the cell have equivalent and complete collections of chromosomes. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Disjunction</h3>
            <p>The process in which the individual chromosomes are being pulled toward the poles by the kinetochore microtubules. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Nondisjunction</h3>
            <p>Nondisjunction is when disjunction fails because the chromosomes fail to seperate. This results in an uneven number of chromosomes on either end of the poles which results in mutations. </p>

        <div class="main">
            <h1>Telophase</h1>
            <h4>Last phase and the seperation of the new cells.</h4>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:300px;">
                <img src="../images/pg4_3.jpg" alt="Cell Cycle" style="width:75%;height:100%;">
            </div>
            <p>In the telophase, two daughter nuclei begin to form in the cell and a nuclear envelope develops using the fragments from the parent cell’s nuclear envelope and other portions of the endomembrane system. The nucleoli reappear and the chromosomes become less condensed. The remaining spindle microtubules are depolymerized, which means they are broken down into smaller molecules and now the division of one nucleus into two genetically identical cells is now complete and is known as mitosis. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Cytokinesis</h3>
            <h4>This is where the cytoplasm divide creating two new cells. </h4>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:350px;">
                <img src="../images/pg4_4.jpg" alt="Cell Cycle" style="width:75%;height:100%;">
            </div>
            <p>This process has already begun by the late telophase and so the daughter cells appear very shortly after the end of mitosis. The cell is pinched in two during the cytokinesis by the formation of a cleavage furrow, A shallow groove in the cell surface near the old metaphase plate, this ultimately ends the process of mitosis. </p>
            <p>In animal cells, the plasma membrane between the cells tightens inward along the cell’s equator until two daughter cells form. </p>
            <p>In plant cells, a cell plate is formed along the equator of the two cells. Then, a new plasma membrane and cell wall is formed along each side of the cell plate.</p>
